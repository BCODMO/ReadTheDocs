Data Management Plan
====================

BCO-DMO has developed a Data Management Plan template to assist investigators 
in submission of plans that meet the NSF OCE Sample and Data Policy requirements. 
The template can be found and completed on the DMPTool website. 
DMPTool is an online application that helps researchers create data management plans. 
The DMPTool provides detailed guidance and links to informational resources and walks a researcher through the process of 
generating a comprehensive plan tailored to specific DMP requirements, in this case, the NSF OCE requirements.
