.. This document describes the different steps of data management that is being made available by BCO-DMO for the broader public

Get started
===========

This page describes the process for contributing metadata and data from appropriate NSF OCE funded projects to the BCO-DMO data system. If you would like to discuss management of data associated with an existing or proposed project, please contact us. For funded projects, please be prepared to provide your NSF OCE award number.
 
I. Should you contribute data to BCO-DMO?
------------------------------------------

You should contribute data to BCO-DMO if your project is funded by NSF OCE's Biological or Chemical Oceanography Sections or the Division of Polar Programs' Antarctic Organisms & Ecosystems Program.

BCO-DMO provides data management services at no additional cost to projects funded by NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences' Biological and Chemical Oceanography Sections and the Division of Polar Programs' Antarctic Organisms & Ecosystems Program. BCO-DMO staff members work with researchers funded by these NSF programs to ensure that data and metadata contributed to BCO-DMO are in compliance with the current NSF OCE Sample and Data Policy (May 2011 version; PDF). To contribute data to BCO-DMO, please see Section II of this page, “How to contribute data to BCO-DMO.”

If your project is funded by another source:

We have a list of some suggested data management centers below.
 
II.            How to contribute data and metadata to BCO-DMO

All datasets submitted to BCO-DMO should be contributed along with the appropriate metadata forms. Forms are Rich Text Format (.rtf) files that are compatible with any word processing application. A description and download link to each form can be found below.

1.    How to Register a Project
2.    How to Contribute Deployments
3.    How to Contribute Data
4.    How to Register a Program

Please email all data and metadata forms to info@bco-dmo.org



1.    How to Register a Project
 
Complete a Project Metadata Form (.rtf) to provide information about projects that are not already registered at BCO-DMO.
A project oversees a collection of one or more datasets.
A project may or may not be part of a larger program.
There is most often one project per NSF award, with the exception of Collaborative Research awards where one project is funded by multiple award numbers.
If you do not yet know the NSF award number, please provide as much information as possible including the project title and investigator contact information.
 
       B.   Submit the Project Metadata Form along with your NSF Data Management Plan, Deployment 
Metadata Form(s) (if applicable), and Dataset Metadata Form(s) to info@bco-dmo.org.
 
2.    How to Contribute Deployments
 
Complete a Deployment Metadata Form (.rtf) to provide information about a specific cruise, mooring, laboratory, or some other unique experience of data collection or analysis.
Complete this form if it is applicable to the dataset(s) you are submitting.
Deployments help to describe the geographic and temporal scale of datasets.
Deployments provide context for mapping the associated data.
 
      B.     Submit the Deployment Metadata Form along with the Dataset Metadata Form(s) to 
info@bco-dmo.org.
 
3.    How to Contribute Data
 
Complete a Dataset Metadata Form (.rtf) along with your data to provide information about each unique dataset collected within a project.
A Dataset Metadata Form should be completed for each dataset contributed to BCO-DMO.
Please send us your processed data when pertaining to acoustics, CTDs, and ADCPs.
We accept data in any format, but comma- or tab-delimited (preferred) ASCII files or Excel spreadsheets are most common
o   If contributing data as an Excel file, please see our tips for submitting data in a spreadsheet.
Sequence accession numbers and the associated data can be contributed to BCO-DMO and we can provide links to the sequence repository (such as NCBI's GenBank). Please see "Contributing Sequence Accession Numbers" for more information.
Most datasets can be contributed as email attachments along with their respective completed Dataset Metadata Form.
o   If the data set is too large to contribute as an email attachment, please contact our office for instructions on the best way to contribute your data.
 
       B.   Submit Dataset Metadata Form(s) and all data files to info@bco-dmo.org


 
What happens next?
After we receive your data and metadata, a data manager will begin the process of making the data available online. Data managers may contact you with follow-up questions or to obtain feedback. You'll be asked to review the data and metadata for completeness and accuracy.
After the data are online and fully documented, our office will ensure that the data are archived properly at the appropriate National Data Center (e.g. National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI). We have developed a partial list of National Data Centers where data managed by BCO-DMO are sent for long-term archive.
Please see our Frequently Asked Questions page for additional information about BCO-DMO.
 
How to Register an NSF Designated Program

Complete a Program Metadata Form (.rtf) to describe a large coordinated research program that is not already registered at BCO-DMO.
 Programs usually encompass one or more projects.
 Examples of Programs include U.S. JGOFS, U.S. GLOBEC, U.S. OCB, and U.S. GEOTRACES.

      B.   Submit the Program Metadata Form along with your NSF Data Management Plan, Project 
Metadata Form, Deployment Metadata Form(s) (if applicable), and Dataset Metadata Form(s) to info@bco-dmo.org.

Other suggested data management centers (if your project is not funded by an NSF section that BCO-DMO serves):
Not all NSF funded projects are supported free of charge by BCO-DMO. Some other recommended data centers include:
For NSF-sponsored Physical Oceanography projects, investigators are encouraged to archive their data directly with the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) .
For marine geology, contact the Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA) group hosted at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University.
For projects supported by NSF Arctic Sciences Program (ARC) investigators, the Arctic Data Center which succeeds the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS), should be contacted. The Arctic Data Center is supported by NSF and is led by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara, to develop and curate the NSF Arctic Data Center, an archive for Arctic scientific data as well as other related research documents.
Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) funded projects can submit data to their regional GoMRI location. See https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/about for additional information including their data management plan under the "Design and Management" menu option.
OCB research community: A series of 'milepost' documents providing guidance to OCB scientists who are uncertain where to submit or propose to submit their data have been being drafted.
