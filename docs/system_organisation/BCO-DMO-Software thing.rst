The BCO-DMO "Automated Data Submission System" is used to
submit data to data centers like NCEI. To use the sytem,
log into OSPREY as a data manager and navigate to a dataset
(for instance, `http://cis.whoi.edu/science/bcodmo-admin/dataset.cfm?id=13352&flag=view <http://cis.whoi.edu/science/bcodmo-admin/dataset.cfm?id=13352&flag=view>`__ ). On that page, you should see the option
to submit that dataset to any number of data centers (as
of this writing, only NODC is supported).

The full documentation for this system can be found in the
attachments to this page. The attached files include:

#. Automated Data Submission Documentation.doc - complete
documentation of the submissions sytem.

#. Automated Data Submission Diagram.pdf - just the diagram
of the submission system

#. Automated Data Submission Diagram.graffle - the OmniGraffle
document from which the PDF was generated.
